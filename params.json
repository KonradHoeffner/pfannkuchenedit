{"name":"PfannkuchenEdit","tagline":"NURBS editor","body":"# PfannkuchenEdit\r\n![PfannkuchenEdit GUI](http://konradhoeffner.de/img/editor_tisch_mit_pokal.gif)\r\n\r\nPfannkuchenEdit is a NURBS editor developed in Java for a computer graphic curse in 2006 as part of the computer sciences diploma curriculum of the University of Leipzig. As such it is just a fun showcase of NURBS, OpenGL, 3D modelling GUIs and whacky but intuitive button design using panncakes (german: Pfannkuchen) for all action buttons. Many pancakes = duplicate object, big and small pancacke = enlarge/shrink, a lonely ring of sugar powder = delete object :-)\r\n\r\nThe NURBS curves library was created by Marcus Daum.\r\nThe icons were created by game artist and animator [Simon Tr√ºmpler](http://simont.de/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
